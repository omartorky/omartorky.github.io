                <p>My fiancé and I booked a private 5 day tour of Egypt with ETP starting in Cairo followed by Aswan, Abu Simbel and Luxor. We just got home and continue to talk about how amazing the trip was.</p>
                <p id="hide" style="display: none;">The communication with ETP was excellent. Very fast responses and they are very accommodating. Our tour was nonstop which was okay by us as we wanted to see all the sights in 4 days.

                    We spent the first two days in Cairo with our guide Ibraham and our driver Yousry. My fiancé and I agree that this duo was our favorite of the trip. We really felt like they went above and beyond for us during those two days. Highly recommend them in Cairo!
                    
                    We then went to Aswan and Abu Simbel for one day and then spent our last day in Luxor. We had great drivers during those two days and great guides as well. Mina in Luxor was very sweet.
                    
                    I would absolutely recommend doing a tour if you are planning to visit Egypt. We usually self navigate on our trips but this is a country where I do not recommend that. The convenience of being transferred everywhere in a nice van (uncommon in Egypt) and also being able to store your luggage in the van (if needed) was awesome. Having guides and drivers to deal with parking and security checkpoints and speaking Arabic is essential. Not to mention the traffic in Egypt is like the video game Frogger just at a faster pace.</p>

            <p>This was the trip of a lifetime that I was able to have with my eldest son - an absolutely amazing experience. To be able to actually see the places and artifacts that I had read about and studied was truly phenomenal. Our hotels were great, the travel to and from sites was completely taken care of, we never felt unsafe or left to our own devices, and the itinerary was just right.</p>
        <p id="hide2" style="display: none;"> But what made the experience so fab was our two guides - Mahmoud Nour in Luxor/Aswan/Abu Simbel and "Max" in Cairo/Memphis/Saqqara. They taught us history and context as it related to each site we visited and they indulged my myriad questions. They were both so incredibly knowledgeable and my questions were never ignored or unanswered. In addition, they shared their culture with us and treated us to some awesome dining experiences. We were reminded that Egypt is more than just ancient ruins. I would recommend without reservation this tour experience. And "hats off" to Mahmoud and Max!!! I left feeling like I had made some great new friends. And I can't wait to try some home-made kushari.</p>

        <p>I did an 8 day tour from Cairo to Aswan then Luxor. The tour was organized beautifully. Very few hiccups if any.<p id="hide3" style="display: none;"> As a solo traveller I felt safe and supported by both Hassan Ali while in Aswan + Luxor and Nora while in Cairo. They were amazing tour guides and really made me want to come back for even longer!</p>

    <p> Where to start! My sister and I booked a five night Cairo, Luxor and Aswan trip with Nile cruise for her birthday. It was a memorable adventure and fulfilled our lifelong dream of exploring the Pyramids, Karnak, Valley of the Kings, Luxor temple and more.</p>
    <p id="hide4" style="display: none;"><br>Everything was organized by the tour agency so we could enjoy our time there; multiple flights, hotel in Cairo, being picked up at the airports, meals…all good. We always felt safe and assured everything would go well.<br><br>We had an unforgettable trip with our awesome guide Hossam Hassan. His vast knowledge and enthusiasm for the history of the revered locations we visited was constantly on display and he made everything truly come to life.<br><br>On top of that, he was always willing to help us out with anything we needed, whether it be a bottle of water, finding authentic souvenirs, or going for a walk outside the boat. His genuine kindness kept our group relaxed, having fun and laughing.<br><br>All of the sites were great. One of our favorite experiences was an add on sunrise hot air balloon trip. If you have the time, definitely recommend it. Simply magical. We also enjoyed our down time on the boat in the pool and up top on the deck.<br><br>If you need anything, the WhatsApp number is responsive. They got us our COVID test results in time for our flight home. If you’re thinking about booking a trip, do it.</p>

        <p>I recently organized a family trip to Egypt via the ETP.<br><br>It concerned a private guided tour in Luxor, Edfu, Aswan, Abu Simbel and Cairo, including a cruise in the Nile river. My impressions from the agency were very positive. Starting with the setup of the tour, the communication with ETP was optimal. During the trip, everything was very well organized and the programme was realized according to what had been agreed and expected.</p> 
        <p id="hide5" style="display: none;"><br>Our main guide for 6 days, Amr, was really helpful, polite, knowledgeable and educated. He took care of everything and made us feel at ease. Moreover his of English was absolutely fluent. Our guide in Cairo, Ismael, was also very kind, friendly and helpful.<br><br>All in all, we had a wonderful time in Egypt and we fully recommend ETP to anyone who look for a reliable local agency to organize a tour for them.        </p>

    <p>I had such an amazing experience in Egypt thanks to Egypt Tours Portal. The company was very professional, organized, punctual, and the communication was excellent. I also had the best tour guides. They all went over and beyond to help make my stay enjoyable.</p>
<p id="hide6" style="display: none;"><br>My first tour was the Pyramids Day Tour with Mr. Mohamed Elshemei. He was very knowledgeable and courteous, and he answered all my questions that came up during the visit to the Pyramids (Giza and Saqqara) and Memphis city. I learned so much from him! And a plus, he knew where to get the best pictures!<br><br>Then, I had the 4 Days Mayfair Nile Cruise from Cairo. My tour guide for the cruise was Mr. Hossam Rashwan. He met me at the airport in Aswan and he and the driver took me to start the tour. Mr. Rashwan was very courteous and friendly (he knew everyone, and everyone spoke highly of him!). He was very knowledgeable and gave me a fantastic tour through the different cities, Aswan, Kom Ombo, Edfu & Luxor. He gave me lots of historical and cultural information and was more than happy to answer my questions. He was a terrific tour guide!<br><br>Back in Cairo, I visited the Islamic and Coptic Cairo. My guide, Mr. Amr Moussa, took me on a comprehensive two-day tour. Walking through all the different places and markets in Cairo was a fantastic and unique experience, it made me feel like a local! Mr. Moussa was very knowledgeable, courteous, and nice, and he made the experience unique and tailored to my interests.<br><br>As a solo traveler, I highly recommend booking your tour with Egypt Tours Portal, and I highly recommend Mr. Rashwan for the Nile cruise, and Mr. Elshemei and Mr. Moussa for the Cairo city tours.<br><br>My trip was insightful and memorable. Thank you all!!</p>
